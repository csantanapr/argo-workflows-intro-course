Let's recap:

* There are two types of input and output: **parameters** and **artifacts**.
* **Parameters** are just short strings.
* **Artifacts** are simply files or directories that are compressed and uploaded to an **artifact repository** such as
  S3.
* For one task to use the output of another task, declare a dependency using a DAG template or steps template.
