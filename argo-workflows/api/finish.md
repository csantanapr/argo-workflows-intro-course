Let's recap:

* You can use the **info endpoint** to check connectivity.
* You need to create an **access token** to use the API.
* API endpoints use JSON not YAML.
* **Webhooks** allow you integrate with any service that supports them.
* You should use the `api/v1/events` endpoint for create workflows.
* You can find **API docs** in the user interface.
